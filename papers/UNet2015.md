## Abstract (excerpt)

"The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method ..."

## Claim Verification Against `references.md`

Reference entry claim matches: provides convolutional network for biomedical image segmentation (encoder-decoder with skip connections).

Verified Points:

- Encoder-decoder (contracting + expanding) path with skip connections for precise localization.
- Demonstrated strong performance on ISBI neuronal segmentation challenge, outperforming sliding-window CNN.
- Efficient training using heavy data augmentation.
- Achieved fast inference (sub-second per 512x512 image on GPU).

No correction needed.

## Notable Contributions

- Symmetric encoder-decoder with feature map concatenation.
- Class balancing via weight maps to emphasize borders.
- Overlap-tile strategy for seamless segmentation on large images.

## Follow-on Patterns

- Influenced general "UNet-style" architectures in medical imaging, segmentation, diffusion model denoisers, and vision tasks (UNet backbones in Stable Diffusion).
