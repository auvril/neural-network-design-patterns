## Abstract (excerpt)

"Layer normalization computes normalization statistics (mean and variance) across the summed inputs to the neurons within a layer for a single training case, enabling stable and efficient training independent of batch size and readily applicable to recurrent networks."

## Claim Verification Against `references.md`

Reference entry claim: "Layer Normalization." Verified; the paper introduces layer-wise per-example normalization removing batch-size dependence and facilitating application to RNNs.

Verified Points:

- Uses per-example (not batch) statistics across hidden units in a layer.
- Eliminates discrepancy between training and inference (same computation both phases).
- Stabilizes hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.
- Provides faster convergence compared with prior techniques (e.g., batch norm variants) in certain settings.

No correction needed.

## Notable Contributions

- Normalization pattern independent of batch size.
- Technique readily applicable to RNNs at each time step.
- Adds learnable gain and bias parameters post-normalization analogous to BatchNorm.

## Follow-on Patterns

- Adopted as default in Transformers (with residual + dropout sequencing variants: Pre-LN, Post-LN).
- Inspired RMSNorm and other simplified/efficient normalization layers.
