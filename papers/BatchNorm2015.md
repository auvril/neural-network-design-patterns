## Abstract (excerpt)

"Batch Normalization normalizes layer inputs for each mini-batch, allowing higher learning rates, reducing internal covariate shift, acting as a regularizer, and improving convergence; achieves new state-of-the-art on ImageNet classification with reduced training steps."

## Claim Verification Against `references.md`

Reference entry claim: "Batch Normalization." Verified; the paper introduces per-mini-batch normalization of activations to mitigate internal covariate shift, accelerate training, and improve accuracy.

Verified Points:

- Normalizes pre-activation distributions via batch statistics (mean/variance) with learnable scale and shift.
- Enables higher learning rates and reduced need for careful initialization.
- Improves ImageNet classification accuracy (top-5 4.9% val error with ensemble) and reduces training steps.
- Regularization effect sometimes reduces need for Dropout.

No correction needed.

## Notable Contributions

- Formalization of internal covariate shift mitigation.
- Integration pattern: normalization + affine transform per channel.
- Practical training tweaks (higher LR, remove Dropout) leading to faster convergence.

## Follow-on Patterns

- Inspired LayerNorm, InstanceNorm, GroupNorm, RMSNorm, Weight Standardization.
- Ubiquitous in CNN architectures until recent transformer-centric shift.
