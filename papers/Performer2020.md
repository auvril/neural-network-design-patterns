## Abstract (excerpt)

"Performers approximate softmax attention using Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features (FAVOR+) enabling linear time & space complexity w.r.t. sequence length while preserving attention quality."

## Claim Verification Against `references.md`

Reference entry claim (Performer2020) implies efficient attention; verified: Introduces FAVOR+ random feature mechanism yielding unbiased / low-variance estimator of softmax attention enabling scalable transformer variants.

Verified Points:

- FAVOR+ positive orthogonal random features approximate softmax kernel.
- Achieves linear complexity O(n) per attention head with respect to sequence length n.
- Provides theoretical grounding (unbiased estimator under conditions) and empirical results on long sequences.

No correction needed.

## Notable Contributions

- Kernel feature map approach to attention approximation avoiding sparsity/low-rank assumptions.
- Orthogonal random features for variance reduction.
- General framework applicable to other kernels (Gaussian, softmax variants).

## Follow-on Patterns

- Inspired efficient attention designs (e.g., linear transformers, fast kernel-based attention) and integration in long-sequence modeling libraries.
