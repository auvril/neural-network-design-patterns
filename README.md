> A collaborative open-source book project documenting neural network design patterns in the style of the Gang of Four's seminal work on software design patterns.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This project aims to create a comprehensive, community-driven reference for neural network design patterns — reusable solutions to common problems in deep learning architecture design. By applying proven software engineering pattern methodologies to neural networks, we're building a systematic approach to understanding and implementing modern deep learning architectures.

## 📖 What You'll Find Here

This repository contains the complete manuscript and supporting materials for a multi-volume treatise on neural network design patterns:

### 🎯 Current Phase: Volume I Foundation

We're currently focusing on the foundational three chapters:

- **Chapter 1:** Principles of Neural Architecture Design
- **Chapter 2:** Anatomy of a Neural Design Pattern
- **Chapter 3:** Creational Patterns

**Target Audience:** Experienced ML practitioners, researchers, and engineers looking to design robust, maintainable neural architectures.
