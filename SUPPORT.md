# Support Guidelines

This project is an open collaborative manuscript. Support focuses on contribution guidance rather than end-user runtime issues.

## Where to Ask

- General questions: GitHub Discussions (Q&A category)
- Idea proposals: Discussions (Ideas) or issue with `enhancement` label
- Pattern additions: Issue with `pattern` label
- Chapter feedback: Issue with `chapter` label
- Glossary or references: Issue with `glossary` / `references` label

## Before Opening an Issue

1. Search existing issues and discussions.
1. Check `docs/overview/quick-start.md` for onboarding steps.
1. Review `CONTRIBUTING.md` for style and template guidelines.

## Expected Response Times

- Triage: within 3 business days
- Initial review comments: within 5–7 days
- High priority (blocking milestone): accelerated (1–2 days)

## Quality of Questions

Include:

- Context (file, section, pattern)
- What you tried
- Specific uncertainty (terminology, citation, structure)

## Non-Scope

We don’t provide:

- Proprietary model debugging
- Production deployment advice
- Custom architecture consulting

## Escalation

If a discussion stalls, mention a maintainer or add `review` label for visibility.

## Code of Conduct

All support interactions are covered by `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
