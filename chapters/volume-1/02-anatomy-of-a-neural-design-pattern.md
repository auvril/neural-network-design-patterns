# Anatomy of a Neural Design Pattern

Goals
- Define the canonical template and notation for all patterns in the book.

Contents
1. Pattern Template (Intent → Motivation → Applicability → Structure → Participants → Collaborations → Consequences → Implementation → Pseudocode → Known Uses → Related Patterns → Testing → References)
2. Notation and Graphs
   - Block graph conventions (producer, interface, consumer, controller)
   - Tensor shapes and axis naming
3. Relationships
   - Composition, specialization, substitution, opposition
4. Worked Example
   - Residual Bridge pattern written using the template

TODOs
- TODO: diagram(pattern-uml)
- TODO: example(residual-bridge)
